The First Minister signed the Edinburgh Agreement that laid the ground for the Independence Referendum 2014 was to be the decisive vote on the future of Scotland within the United Kingdom. It was to be a once in a lifetime vote. It proved to be destructive and divisive to Scottish society.

"There shouldn't be any arrangements full stop. Putting aside that any vote without our real Government in Westminster's approval would be illegal, this proposed ""Bill"" is a disgrace - the SNP have lied to the Scottish people about the last independence vote being a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity and are continuing to fail the country by focusing on continual anti-Tory rhetoric, stoking up resentment with unfounded claims of xenophobia following the Brexit vote and using a bullshit argument that the only reason Scots voted to remain in the UK was to stay part of the EU, (nothing to do with the lack of any SNP plan for an independent Scotland that is not utter fantasy!).   The SNP should be ashamed of themselves. They have spent almost the last decade running this country into the ground and blaming ""Westmonster"". Given their economic arguments they obviously have no clue how to run a country and are LUCKY to be part of the UK and its ability to pay Scotland's way. Raising a new referendum is either an attempt to disguise that fact, or, purely an attempt by Sturgeon to cling to control of this cultist party - not exactly ""Stronger for Scotland"" is it?
